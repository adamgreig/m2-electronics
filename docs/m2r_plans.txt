M2R Plans
=========


RockBLOCK Module
    rb_queue_message(char* msg)
        Queues a message for transmission.
    In thread loop, continually queries RockBLOCK to determine possibility to
    transmit, sends messages from queue, ensures at most one message per 20
    seconds.


uBlox Module
    Configures ublox
    Continually fetches position data from the ublox
    Makes position data available via a struct-returning function with lock


Radio Module
    radio_queue_message(char* msg)
    In thread loop, takes messages off stack and transmits.
    Modulates bitstream to AFSK RTTY or something.
    error correction??? huffman coding (7, 4) perhaps? or just cross fingers...
    queue size: really don't accept more than one pending message during tx or
    we'll never catch up.


Serial Module
    must send and receive messages
    serial_tx(char*)
    serial_rx_register_cb(char*)
    

Dispatch Module
    route messages between rockblock, ubloc, radio and serial
    GPS updates over rockblock quite regularly
    peak altitude updates over rockblock too (maybe send raw pressure)
