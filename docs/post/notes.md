## Thoughts drop
Mention Metrons not having enough DC so needing pulses, which worked but was 
not ideal.
Magno was unreliable at best. Gyro wasn't great either. I2C sensors...
SD card came off. Use eMMC?
M2RL was a bit weird. Could have been integrated onto the boards. Or don't 
design like that. Maybe good for multiple stages though.
