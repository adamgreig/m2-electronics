# Serial Handling

Ideally common between M2R and M2FC.

Something to source and sink M2Telem packets and react appropriately..

M2FC body only sources M2Telem packets and sends them to M2FC Nose.
M2FC nose sinks packets from M2FC Body but should immediately retransmit to
M2R, and also sources its own packets to send to M2R.

All devices should present a shell interface on their serial interfaces.

Overview of logic and packet routing...

Really need the status managment thing first which is responsible for
generating the outgoing packets. 

So first things first, the normal serial interface (not via xbee).

# M2Serial

Use ChibiOS Serial driver. transmit_packet(TelemPacket)
