# Martlet 2 Radio Board

This PCB transmits rocket telemetry (lat, lng, alt, max alt) over a satellite
radio and 70cm radio link.

The satellite radio uses a RockBLOCK Iridium modem. The 70cm link will use an
NTX2b from Radiometrix with a standard 1/4 wave antenna, in a similar setup to
the usual HAB case.

There's some possibility for clever radio modes and coding to be used, but it
will depend on how much time is available.
