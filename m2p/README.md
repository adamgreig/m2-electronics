# Martlet 2 Pyrotechnic Board

This PCB is responsible for firing the pyrotechnic protractors used to decouple
the nosecone from the rocket body and to release the main parachute. 

An accelerometer and a barometer are used to determine when to fire the
pyrotechnics.

The plan is for two of these boards to be used. One is installed in the nose
cone where it can fire the two protractors used to eject the nosecone up, and
the other is installed in the main body of the rocket where it fires one
protractor to release the main parachute.
